## [📖 Presentation 📖]

A Plugin MC which make Minecraft looks like to Dead By Daylight.

This plugin has been made by myself, EternalRat.

The goal of this plugin is to entirely reproduce the game named "Dead By Daylight".
It has been designed for the MC 1.14 version.

## [⚽ Goal ⚽]

So, you will have 3 generators in the whole map. Your goal will be to find them, and turn them back on.
Each time you'll try, the killer will have an indicator in his screen if you're doing it too fast.
So, be fast but not too much and silent. Otherwise you might never go home one day.

## [🔨 How to use it 🔨]

Firstly, you'll have to put the plugin into the folder "plugins" in your own server.
Then, you'll have to invite atleast 2 friends to play with you.
If all of that is good, you'll need to write "/start", and the game will start.

## [🎭 Roles 🎭]

This game is composed of 3 roles.

### The survivor. 🙎‍♂️

The survivor is a basic character, which the only one goal is to escape of this place.
He'll need to find the 3 generators and turn them back on in order to accomplish his goal.
Otherwise, the killer will find him.

### The guard. 👮‍♂️

The role of the guard is simple, he'll need to keep an eye on some cameras installed everywhere in the map.
He'll need to notify every move of the killer when he sees it for survivors to escape safely.
If survivors die, the guard will also loose.

### The killer. 🔪

His role is simple as ever, he'll just need to find the survivors and kill all of them until the last.
If survivors turn back on all generators, the killer will loose.
He'll be able to place traps, and reduce the power of the generator.
